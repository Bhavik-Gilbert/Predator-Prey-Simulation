## About
### Base Code
>Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes  
This project is part of the material for chapter 10 of the book

> A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in an enclosed rectangular field.
This is the first version of the simulation. This version does not use inheritance.
  
### Enhancements
>Authors: **Bhavik Gilbert** and **Heman Seegolam**  
> A predator-prey simulation involving animals including: dodo's, wolves, humans, pigs and monkeys; plants; and external effects such as weather, disease and
> a day and night cycle, which will have an affect on the possibility of actions occuring and what actions can be taken for a given species.
    
## Technologies
### Framworks/Languages
>This application is built using the JPanel library alongside the ExecutorService library in Java .
### Hosting
>This repository can be downloaded and run by anyone who has a java compiler installed with the neccessary dependencies to run JPanel installed.
  
  
## Usage
### Getting started
>Create a Simulator object.  
>Then call one of:  
>+ simulateOneStep - for a single step.  
>+ simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.  
>+ runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
